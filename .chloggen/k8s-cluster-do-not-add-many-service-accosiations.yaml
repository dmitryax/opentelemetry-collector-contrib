  If pod has many matching services, it's typically a sign that the pod is an ingress controller. 
  In this case, associating the pod with all the services doesn't provide any useful information.
  This change is intended to avoid the overhead of associating the pod with all the services.
  It only affects the experimental entity signal exported by the receiver, it doesn't affect metrics.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
